Test data for the Hospital Capacity Test Data Set includes a sample measure, and locations and organizations
resources representing hospitals in Cook County, Illinois, and in the State of Rhode Island, as well as data for the
State of New Jersey (aggregated reports).

### Predefined Measure for the Hospital Capacity Test Data Set
This implementation guide includes a sample measure describing the measurements
that were required to be reported to CDC/NHSN earlier this year for Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity.
This measure is only provided as examples to illustrate measure development and reporting.  Official reporting
requirements are established by HHS and other US Federal agencies and not by this guide.

* [CDC/NHSN Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity Reporting Measures](Measure-CDCPatientImpactAndHospitalCapacity.html)
  defines a measure that is aligned with the reporting previously required by the
  [National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC/NHSN)](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html) using the COVID-19 Patient
  Impact and Hospital Capacity module.


#### Cook County, Illinois and Rhode Island Hospitals
The organizations and locations referenced in this data set exist in the real world, but the measure report data included for
those is all test data, and is not related to any actual events occuring in real life.

This data can be be used to prepopulate a FHIR Server to support test cases for the Measure Consumer, and
Measure Source actors, and the Measure Intermediary actors.
