This section describes the COMPUTE-MX of this guide. This transaction is used by the Measure Source, Measure Consumer and Measure Computer actors.

### Scope

The Compute Measure transaction describes the behavior of the Measure Computer actor in periodically computing and reporting on measures.


This transaction enables automatic computing of measure reports.


### Actors Roles

#### Compute Measure


The Measure Computer computes the measure report for the current reporting period.


##### Trigger Event - The current reporting period has elapsed.

See the [Reporting Period](StructureDefinition-ReportingPeriod.html) extension


##### Message Semantics

The Measure Computer prepares a Measure Report.


##### Expected Actions

#### Report Measure


The Measure Computer reports the newly computed measure for the current reporting period.


##### Trigger Event - A new MeasureReport resource is available for reporting.

##### Message Semantics

The Measure Computer reports the computed result via the grouped MeasureSource actor.


##### Expected Actions

#### Query Measure


The Measure Computer responds to a query for a Measure Report with the newly computed report for the current reporting period.


##### Trigger Event - The Measure Consumer has requested measure reports with criteria matching the newly created report.

##### Message Semantics

The Measure Computer reports the computed result via the grouped MeasureSource actor.


##### Expected Actions
