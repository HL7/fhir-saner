The overall SANER is an API between [multiple actors](actors.html#actor-options), and
[Transactions types](transactions.html). The tests that can be executed are limited to the functionality
of the system-under-test (SUT), and the transaction type it implements. Where that SUT has a specific
function, it can be tested.

### Test Plan

The following is the overall test plan for SANER alone:
* Unit Tests -- automation of testing of the actor alone using a simulator and validator tool
  * [Measure Source](actors.html#measure-source) publishes content
  * [Measure Consumer](actors.html#measure-consumer) consumes content
  * [Measure Computer](actors.html#measure-computer) automates creation of content
  * [Measure Definition Source](actors.html#measure-definition-source) provides Measure resource content
  * [Measure Definition Consumer](actors.html#measure-definition-consumer) consumes Measure resource content
* Integration Tests -- automation of actors interacting through defined communications mechanism
  * [Measure Intermediary](actors.html#measure-intermediary) consumes and publishes
  * [Push Option](actors.html#push-option) transaction method exercised
  * [Pull Option](actors.html#pull-option) transaction method exercised
* Validation Tests -- user expectation based testing

### Unit Test Procedure

Unit Tests in this context is where a SUT is tested against a simulator or validator.  A simulator is a
implementation of an actor that is designed specifically to test the oposite pair actor. The simulator
might be a reference implementation or may be a specially designed test-bench. Where a reference
implementation is used the negative tests are harder to simulate. A validator is a implementation
that can check conformance. A validator may be a simulator, but may also be a standalone tool used
to validate only a message encoding. Some reference implementations may be able to validate to a
StructureDefinition profile, but often these do not include sufficient constraints given the
overall actor conformance criteria.

#### Measure Source

Unit Tests for Measure Source actor test that it can produce valid content.

##### Positive Test Scenarios
* Provide a CapabilityStatement resource with indications of support of the SANER Measure Source actor
* Test output from Measure Source is valid
  * Action: Validate content to the SANER StructureDefinition
    * [PublicHealthMeasureReport](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasure.html)
	* [PublicHealthMeasure](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasureReport.html)
* Test output from Measure Source is accurate to expected values published
  * Given some specific input to the SUT, that it produces output with correct values
* Optional test audit events "exist"
  * no validation yet possible as this is underspecified

##### Negative Test Scenarios
Negative tests are deliberate deviations from "happy path". They would not all be failure-modes. They must
all be handled gracefully in a way appropriate to the SUT functionality.
* Measure Intermediary or Measure Consumer returns failure-mode, Measure Consumer handles failure gracefully

#### Measure Consumer
Unit Tests for Measure Consumer actor test that it can consume valid and invalid content robustly.

##### Postive Test Scenarios
* provide CapabilityStatement indicating support of the SANER Measure Consumer actor
* submit sample measures from SANER examples are consumed and made available in the Measure Consumer as expected by SUT functionality
  * [Public Health Measure Examples](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasure-examples.html)
  * [Public Health Measure Report Examples](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasureReport.html)
* Optional test audit events "exist"
  * no validation yet possible as this is underspecified

##### Negative Test Scenarios
Negative tests are deliberate deviations from "happy path". They would not all be failure-modes. They must all be
handled gracefully in a way appropriate to the SUT functionality.
* submit non-FHIR data (random data)
* submit valid FHIR Observation (from fhir core one of the examples)
  * http://build.fhir.org/observation-example-f001-glucose.html
* submit valid FHIR Measure that is not SANER compliant (from fhir core one of the examples?)
  * http://build.fhir.org/measurereport-cms146-cat3-example.html
* submit valid SANER Measure that has extra data not minimally necessary
  * TBD
* submit valid SANER Measure that has measures that are outside natural boundary for that measure (e.g. negative integer for counts)
  * TBD
* submit valid SANER Measure that have random data that are valid
  * TBD

#### Measure Intermediary
*

### Integration Test Procedure

Integration Tests in this context is where two SUT of paired actors test against each other. In this case the subset of
tests that can be tested is the intersection. Testing only this intersection is necessary but not sufficient. The testing
must also include the capability of the client (Measure Source or Measure Consumer) to exercise the test scenarios that
this SUT can test, to determine that failure-modes are handled properly by both SUT.

### Validation Test Procedure


### Test scripts

#### Using Cucumber
TODO: Write specific Cucumber statements, might use external tooling?

#### Using FHIR TestScript and ExampleScenario
TODO:
