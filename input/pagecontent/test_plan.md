Overall this guide provides an API between [multiple actors](actors.html#actor-options), and
[Transactions types](transactions.html). The tests that can be executed are limited to the functionality
of the system-under-test (SUT), and the transaction type it implements. Where that SUT has a specific
function, it can be tested.

### Test Plan

The following is the overall test plan for this guide:
* Unit Tests -- automation of testing of the actor alone using a simulator and validator tool
* Integration Tests -- automation of actors interacting through defined communications mechanism
* Validation Tests -- user expectation based testing

Tests below support testing for the following actors:
  * [Measure Source](actors.html#measure-source) publishes MeasureReport content
  * [Measure Consumer](actors.html#measure-consumer) consumes MeasureReport content
  * [Measure Computer](actors.html#measure-computer) automates creation of MeasureReport content from a Measure
  * [Measure Definition Source](actors.html#measure-definition-source) provides Measure resource content
  * [Measure Definition Consumer](actors.html#measure-definition-consumer) consumes Measure resource content
  * [Measure Intermediary](actors.html#measure-intermediary) consumes MeasureReport resource from one system as a
  MeasureConsumer and provides (possibly transformed) content to a second system as a MeasureSource.

### Measure Source
The Measure Source reports results for a single facility, results for a collection of facilities, or aggregated data for a region.

#### Measure Source Preparation
1. Be able to produce a MeasureReport resource for the [example Measure](Measure-ComputableCDCPatientImpactAndHospitalCapacity.html).
2. Load realistic sample data into your system to populate a MeasureReport.
3. These data should be sufficiently distinctive that you can recognize them in a MeasureReport or in someone else's system.
4. If you're doing the publication scenario, have a client that can do a [MeasureReport create](transaction-1.html).
5. If you're doing the retrieval scenario, have a server that can respond to a [MeasureReport search](transaction-2.html).

#### Measure Source Success Criteria
* For the publication scenario, the MeasureReport based on the sample data is created at a Measure Consumer system.

#### Automated Measure Computation and Reporting
A provider organization application executes the following actions in appropriate roles in the scenario.

1. Application in the role of Measure Definition Consumer retrieves (PULL) a Computable Measure (definition) from a Measure Definition Source
2. Application in the role of Measure Computer uses the Computable Measure to compute against a FHIR Server
3. Application in the role of Measure Source creates a Measure Report based on the Computable Measure, and sends (PUSH) the Measure Report to  Measure Consumer
4. A public health organization application acts as both a Measure Definition Source and a Measure Consumer
   * Measure Definition Source supports queries for a Computable Measure
   * Measure Consumer accepts Measure Reports based on a Computable Measure

For example, identify the FHIR Patient resources in the measure report that were used to calculate the data.

#### Exchanging Updated Measure Definitions
This scenario is planned for the second cycle of testing and involves the Measure Definition Source making a new Computable Measure Definition
available for use. The new Computable Measure Definition will result in at least one different calculated result in a Measure Report based on the
provided test data.  This scenario otherwise follows the Automated Measure Computation and Reporting scenario

of csv, application/csv, or text/csv and the CSV formats are returned.

### Generate and Store a MeasureReport

A Measure Source generates a MeasureReport for the CDC Measure resource (available as part of a ZIP with multiple example resources) using realistic sample data from its system.  Participants manually transmit this MeasureReport by whatever means are expedient.  A Measure Consumer consumes the MeasureReport and stores the measure data.

2. Over multiple sites, turning MeasureReport resources from multiple facilities in the same region to a MeasureReport describing the region.
3. Within a facility, collecting data from several reporting systems into a singular MeasureReport containing data from all systems.

#### Aggregate MeasureReport Resources Preconditions
1. MeasureReport resources are available from a single facility covering a period of 7 consectutive days for different types of Measures (count, point-in-time, and cumulative).
2. MeasureReport resources are available from multiple facilities within a region (e.g. Cook County, IL, the State of Rhode Island).
3. MeasureReport resources for the same measure and time period are available within a single facility, covering different sets of data.

#### Aggregate MeasureReport Resources Preconditions
1. A MeasureReport is created where data is aggregated appropriately for different the measure types in the MeasureReport resources.
2. A MeasureReport resource is communicated to a MeasureConsumer that contains a consolidated report across facilities.
3. A MeasureReport resource is created that contains a consolidated report within a single facility having appropriate values.

### Unit Test Procedures
Unit Tests in this context is where a system under test is tested against a simulator or validator.  A simulator is a
implementation of an actor that is designed specifically to test the oposite pair actor. The simulator
might be a reference implementation or may be a specially designed test-bench. Where a reference
implementation is used the negative tests are harder to simulate. A validator is a implementation
that can check conformance. A validator may be a simulator, but may also be a standalone tool used
to validate only a message encoding. Some reference implementations may be able to validate to a
StructureDefinition profile, but often these do not include sufficient constraints given the
overall actor conformance criteria.

### Unit Testing
Unit Tests for Measure Source and Measure Definition Source actor test that these actors can produce valid content.

##### Positive Test Scenarios
* Provide a CapabilityStatement resource with indications of support of the SANER Measure Source or Measure Definition Source actors
* Test output from Measure Source or Measure Definition Source is valid
  * Validate content to the StructureDefinition for Measure Source
    * [PublicHealthMeasureReport](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasure.html)
	* [PublicHealthMeasure](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasureReport.html)
  * Validate content to the StructureDefinition for Measure Definition Source
    * [PublicHealthMeasure](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasureReport.html)
    * [PublicHealthMeasureLibrary](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasureLibrary.html)
* Test output from Measure Source or Measure Definition Source is accurate to expected values published
* Verify that audit events exist and conform to the profiles in this guide.

##### Negative Test Scenarios
Negative tests are deliberate deviations from "happy path". They would not all be failure-modes. They must
all be handled gracefully in a way appropriate to the SUT functionality.
* Measure Intermediary or Measure Consumer returns failure-mode, Measure Consumer handles failure gracefully

#### Measure Consumer
Unit Tests for Measure Consumer actor test that it can consume valid and invalid content robustly.

##### Postive Test Scenarios
* Measure Consumer provides a CapabilityStatement indicating support of the Measure Consumer actor
* Submit sample measures from SANER examples are consumed and made available in the Measure Consumer as expected by system functionality
  * [Public Health Measure Examples](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasure-examples.html)
  * [Public Health Measure Report Examples](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasureReport.html)
* Verify that audit events exist and conform to the profiles in this guide.

##### Negative Test Scenarios
Negative tests are deliberate deviations from "happy path". They would not all be failure-modes. They must all be
handled gracefully in a way appropriate to the SUT functionality.
* Submit a non-FHIR data (random data)
  * The receiver should fail (except in the case where allowances have been made for CSV conversion).
* Submit a valid FHIR Observation (from fhir core one of the examples)
  * e.g., http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-example-f001-glucose.html
  * The receiver should fail, as the resource does not meet the expectations from the API.
* Submit a valid FHIR Measure that is not SANER compliant (e.g. one of the Measure examples in the Core FHIR specification).
  * e.g., http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/measurereport-cms146-cat3-example.html
  * The reciever may succeed or fail.  If the receiver as a FHIR Server, it would generally accept resources for a wide variety of use
    cases.  A receiver designed specifically to support only those capabilities defined by this guide may reject the submission because
    it does not meet the business rules associated with the use of this endpoint.
