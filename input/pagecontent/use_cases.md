The following use cases were used to identify the requirements addressed by this guide:

* [Collecting Hospital and Ventilator Measures](#collecting-hospital-and-ventilator-measures)
* [Accessing Measure Reports](#accessing-measure-reports)
* [Distributing Measure Definitions](#distributing-measure-definitions)
* [Automating Measure Computation](#automating-measure-computation)
* [Reporting Supplemental Data](#reporting-supplemental-data)


These are described in more detail in the sections that follow.


### Collecting Hospital and Ventilator Measures

This use case addresses the collection and exchange of data from several information systems in a Facility
to a centralized reporting system that communicates to Public Health. The ICU/Central Monitoring System collects data
for multiple data elements by examining messages recieved and data in its database, and then reports these to a Measure
Collector
within the hospital.


This use case is supported by the following

* Actors

  - [Measure Source](actors.html#measure-source)

  - [Measure Consumer](actors.html#measure-consumer)

* Transactions

  - [Query Measure](transaction-1.html)

  - [Produce Measure](transaction-2.html)

#### Collecting Hospital and Ventilator Measures Process Flow 

Measure report data can come from multiple systems within a facility. For example, the CDC/NHSN Patient Impact
and Hospital Capacity Module asks for the following data elements:

1. **Patient Impact**
1. Hospitalized Patients w/ COVID-19
2. Hospitalized and Ventilated Patients w/ COVID-19
3. Patients with Hospital Onset of COVID-19
4. Patients in ED/Overflow w/ COVID-19
5. Ventilated Patients in ED/Overflow w/ COVID-19
6. Patient Deaths due to COVID-19
2. **Hospital Bed/ Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/ Ventilator Capacity**
1. Total number of available (inpatient and outpatient) beds
2. Total Acute staffed beds
3. Total Occupied Beds
4. Total ICU Beds
5. Total Occupied ICU Beds
6. Total Ventilators
7. Total Ventilators in Use


These data elements are often not available through a single system. For example, an
[ICU/Central Monitoring System](technology_environment.html#icucentral-monitoring-systems) might
have knowledge of 1.2,5 and 2.4-7 above, while the
[Bed Management System](technology_environment.html#bed-management-aka-housekeeping-systems) could report
on 2.1-3, the Hospital's [EHR](technology_environment.html#ehr-systems) is aware of 1.1, 1.3 and 1.6, and the
[Emergency Department system](technology_environment.html#emergency-department-systems) can provide
an update on 1-4.

In order to automate capture of this information, a central reporting system (e.g., a FHIR Server) can be made
available to accept partial reports for data. This data can then be aggregated from reports made by the various
information systems, and forwarded to a public endpoint for reporting.

1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="GETVALUES">ICU/Central Monitoring System collects data</html:span>

   The ICU/Central Monitoring System is triggered (by request or schedule) to generate
a report on ICU beds and equipment, including ventilated patients in ED/Overflow w/ COVID-19,
Total ICU Beds, Occupied ICU Beds, Total Ventilators, Ventilators in Use.


   
1. The system collects information about ventilators outside the ICU for which the associated patient
was admitted for suspected or confirmed COVID-19. It can makes the determination of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 from
the DG1 segment of the ADT message it recieved regarding the patient.
2. The system counts the number of ICU beds that it has been configured to recognize and which are operational
3. The system counts the number of ICU beds that are transmitting telemetry (patient monitoring) information.
4. The system counts the number of ventilators that it has been configured to recognize and which are operational
5. The system counts the number of ventilators that are transmitting telemetry data to it in the ICU.

on multiple data elements
(measure populations)</html:span>

   Multiple collected values are aggregated into a report which is then transmitted to the Measure Collector.


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="GETHOSPITALBEDS">Bed Management System Reports
on multiple data elements
(measure populations)</html:span>

   The Hospitals Bed Management System collects data for multiple data elements by
examining messages recieved and data in its database, and then reports these to a Measure Collector
within the hospital.


   
1. The Bed Management System examines master file data to count the total number of beds in the hospital,
as well as those beds specifically identified as being for acute (inpatient) care. The Bed Management solution can be a
component
of the EHR, or as occurs in some hospital settings, a third party solution that integrates with the EHR (usually through ADT
and master file
messages).
2. The bed management system counts the occupied beds (based on current state of each bed) as tracked through
state changes communicated through ADT messages. The Bed Management solution might be used to support housekeeping, or to support
an [electronic
bedboard](https://it.johnshopkins.edu/services/applications/administrative/ebb.html) that might used by a hospital
"[Bed Czar](http://www.ihi.org/resources/Pages/Changes/RealTimeDemandCapacityManagement.aspx)."


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="GETCOVID19DATA">EHR System reports
on multiple data elements
(measure populations)</html:span>

   The Hospital's EHR collects data for multiple data elements.


   
1. The EHR collects data on hospitalized patients w/ COVID-19.
2. The EHR collects data on hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 14 days after admission.
3. The EHR collects data on patient deaths due to COVID-19.

1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="BED-STEP1">Measure Collector aggregates reports for
transmission to a Public Health Agency</html:span>

   Either periodically on some schedule configured for the hospital, or upon recieving a
full set of data, the Measure Collector gathers a set of results from different systems
that have communicated them, putting together a complete MeasureReport for later reporting to the Public Health Agency.


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="BED-STEP3">Transmit Aggregated MeasureReport Data</html:span>

   In a "push" model, the Measure Collector sends the aggregated MeasureReport to a MeasureConsumer (e.g., a Public
Health endpoint used for measure transmission).


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="BED-STEP4">A Public Health Agency queries the
hospitals Measure Collector
for the most recent reports.</html:span>

   As an alternative to push, the Public Health Agency can also "pull" data by querying the Hospitals
"Measure Collector" endpoint (in fact, a FHIR Server with some additional features supporting aggregation).


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="BED-STEP5">Transmit Aggregated MeasureReport Data</html:span>

   The Measure Collector sends the aggregated MeasureReports to the requesting Public Health Agency.


### Accessing Measure Reports

A public health user queries a reporting system to report on a measure for a region.


This use case is supported by the following

* Actors

  - [Measure Consumer](actors.html#measure-consumer)

  - [Measure Intermediary](actors.html#measure-intermediary)

* Transactions

  - [Communicate Results](transaction-1.html)

#### Accessing Measure Reports Process Flow 

In this use case, we see the classic "dashboard" panel, where a public health user
selects a region, and one or more measures (or functions of measures) to report on, and the data is presented
to them in an easy to view format.


![Figure 2.3.1.2-1: Accessing Measure Reports Process Flow](usecase2-processflow.svg "Figure 2.3.1.2-1: Accessing Measure Reports Process Flow")

**Figure 2.3.1.2-1: Accessing Measure Reports Process Flow**


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="Aggregating-STEP2">Measure Consumer component of a Measure Intermediary gathers data from one or Measure Sources</html:span>

   The Measure Intermediary, acting as a Measure Consumer gathers and aggregates data (possibly computing a
function with other associated data) from one or more Measure Sources,
and makes them available through a Measure Source interface it provides.


   The specific ordering in which gathering and aggregation is performed is not further specified
by this implementation guide. It is shown as occuring before the user initiates the query here, but could also occur
after. However, for many cases, geospatial systems can likely do a better job if the aggregation is done ahead of time.
The application of a function to the data can enable a measure such as # of cases to be combined with other data such as
population for the area to report # of cases per 10K population, or similar functions to better present data
in a way that allows it to be reported using comparable scales.


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="Reporting-STEP1">User Initiates Search</html:span>

   The Public Health User navigates to a web page where collected data is reported.


   The user selects a geographic region and an issue of concern (e.g., beds, ventilators, PPE). The Measure Consumer
collects the appropriate reports
and displays the results.


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="">Display Results</html:span>

   The Measure Consumer displays an overview of aggregated regional results to the
user, and additional links which enable navigation to finer grained or alternative displays.


   Data can be displayed as aggregated or fine-grained status information based
on the current focus of the public health user. It may be shown as a map, a table, or a graph.


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="Reporting-STEP2">User refines Focus or Form of Display</html:span>

   The Public Health User selects a new form of display (e.g., Map, table or graph) or refines their
focus (e.g., wider or smaller region).


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="">Display Refined Results</html:span>

   The Measure Repository modifies the users focus and reporting format


### Distributing Measure Definitions

A public health or emergency response agency distributes updated Measure definitions, a hospital or intermediary
retrieves these definitions for reporting.


This use case is supported by the following

* Actors

  - [Measure Definition Source](actors.html#measure-definition-source)

  - [Measure Definition Consumer](actors.html#measure-definition-consumer)

* Transactions

  - [Query Measure Definition](transaction-1.html)

#### Distributing Measure Definitions Process Flow 

Measures created for tracking a public health emergency may be revised periodically to support changing needs. This
use case supports the need
to distribute updated measure definitions to organizations who report on these measures.


![Figure 2.3.1.3-1: Distributing Measure Definitions Process Flow](usecase3-processflow.svg "Figure 2.3.1.3-1: Distributing Measure Definitions Process Flow")

**Figure 2.3.1.3-1: Distributing Measure Definitions Process Flow**


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="Search for updated Measures">Query for New or Updated Measures</html:span>

   An organization required to report queries for for updated from one or public health or emergency response
agencies to identify reporting requirements.


   

1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="BED-STEP5">Return matching measure specifications</html:span>

   The agency sends the new or updated definitions to the requesting reporting organization.


### Automating Measure Computation

A reporting organization (e.g., a hospital) automatically computes and reports measure data.


This use case is supported by the following

* Actors

  - [Measure Source](actors.html#measure-source)

  - [Measure Consumer](actors.html#measure-consumer)

  - [Measure Definition Consumer](actors.html#measure-definition-consumer)

  - [Measure Computer](actors.html#measure-computer)

  - [Data Source](actors.html#data-source)

* Transactions

  - [Compute Measure](transaction-1.html)

#### Automating Measure Computation Process Flow 

Automating measure reporting reduces the burden on users for manual data collection. When a measure has been
automated, it
can be computed using FHIR APIs from supporting information systems provided by the organization.


![Figure 2.3.1.4-1: Automating Measure Computation Process Flow](usecase4-processflow.svg "Figure 2.3.1.4-1: Automating Measure Computation Process Flow")

**Figure 2.3.1.4-1: Automating Measure Computation Process Flow**


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="Check for New or Updated Measures">Query for New or Updated Measures</html:span>

   The local EHR or FHIR Server returns the requested data and included resources.


1. <html:span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="Send Measures">Send Measures to a Measure Consumer</html:span>

   The reporting organization sends the computer measure to the public health agency.


### Reporting Supplemental Data

A reporting organization (e.g., a hospital) collects and reports supplemental data with a measure report.


This use case is supported by the following

* Actors

  - [Measure Source](actors.html#measure-source)

  - [Measure Consumer](actors.html#measure-consumer)

  - [Measure Computer](actors.html#measure-computer)

  - [Data Source](actors.html#data-source)

* Transactions

  - [Compute Measure](transaction-1.html)

#### Reporting Supplemental Data Process Flow 

Supplemental data enables additional data analysis to be performed. The MeasureReport itself provides the capacity
to detect
a signal, e.g., increased strain on institutional resources, but does not by itself enable deeper analysis with regard to
level or impact
of this strain. Exchange of additional data elements allow deeper analysis, as might be used to support risk adjustment, or
cause or impact analysis.

Consider the case where patient comorbidities (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease, Smoking Status) are known to impact patient risk and
associated complications, but
where detailed analysis of these risk effects is unknown. Communication of supplemental data that include presence or absence of
cardiovascuar disease, or the
patient smoking status, and presence of absence of complications allows the recieving public health agencies to further analyze this
data retrospectively.

In the initial stages, this analysis can be used to assess strain, by comparing the impact of comorbidities on complications
over time in facilities with
otherwise similar measures of utilization. In later stages, this data can be used to further assess and refine strain created by
disease burden based
on associated complications.
