#### Communicate Measure


Upon completion of this transaction, resource availability data will have been communicated to a
user or system. This can be demonstrated by generation of a report, summary, or other artifact, or by transmission of resource
availability data or some computation over it to another system.


This requirement can be met by a Measure Consumer that consumes and displays data in a Web Browser, consumes data
and transmits it in another format to a public health agency (e.g., using the CDC CSV format), or as a Measure
Intermediary that consumes data from one system and communicates it to another, or transforms it and communicates it back
to the original system or to another system.
