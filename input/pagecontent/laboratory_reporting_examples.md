Test data for the Laboratory Reporting Test Data Set includes a measure, measure reports, and locations
and organizations resources representing aggregate reports for the State of New Jersey over time.  This data
comes from publicly reported data sets published via [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), or the New Jersery
department of public health.  The data is based on real world reports provided at the state level, but should
NOT be considered an authoritative source.

This data can be be used to prepopulate a FHIR Server to support test cases for the Measure Consumer, and
Measure Source actors, and the Measure Intermediary actors.

### Predefined Measure for the Laboratory Reporting Test Data Set
This implementation guide includes a sample measure describing the measurements that were required to be reported
to the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) earlier this year for for hospital laboratory reporting.

* [FEMA Daily Hospital COVID-19 Reporting Measures](Measure-FEMADailyHospitalCOVID19Reporting.html)
  defines a measure that was aligned with the reporting required by the
  [Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.aha.org/advisory/2020-03-30-coronavirus-update-administration-requests-hospitals-report-daily-covid-19)
  for reporting COVID-19 test results from Hospital in-house laboratories.

This data set can be used to test aggregation of measure reports over time for cumulative measurements.
