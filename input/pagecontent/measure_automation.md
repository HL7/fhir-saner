Several studies have shown that automation and standardization for electronic reporting improves
data quality, timeliness, and the quantity of available data in public health reporting [^1][^2].
Developers of a system focusing on reporting for pandemic management in British Columbia note the challenges
of one-off reporting solutions, including operational disruptions to address changing needs[^3].

Among institutions, barriers to reporting include having available systems to report to,
and challenges in interfacing to facility Health IT infrastructure and extracting data from EHR systems[^4].

Thus, measures **should** be automatable where feasible, and integratee with existing Health IT system capabilities.
Automation of measurement is possible when:
1. There is a common information model:
   1. A commonly understood information model and terminology that enables data collection requirements to be
      specified consistently across disparate systems, or <br/>
   2. A general information model which can be eaily adapted via local translations.<br/>
2. There are common workflows that will not significantly impact the interpretation of data.  For example, the workflow
for reporting that a patient is on a ventilator could rely on orders for ventilation, or on flowsheet observations
related to ventilator reported measurements.

3. There are mechanisms to query for information from systems.

### Common Information Model
This IG requires adoption of a national model or implementation guide to ensure that there is a common model for a region.
An incomplete list of national models is provided below:

* [Australian Base](http://hl7.org.au/fhir/aubase1.1/profiles.html)
* [Belgium Core](https://ehealthplatformstandards.github.io/artifacts.html#core-profiles)
* [Canadian Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/scratch-fhir-profiles/CA-Core/artifacts.html)
* [Denmark Core](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/dk-core-r4/artifacts.html)
* [India National Digital Health Mission](https://simplifier.net/NDHM/~resources?fhirVersion=R4&sortBy=DisplayName)
* [Swiss Core](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7ch/ch-core/artifacts.html)
* [UK Core](https://simplifier.net/guide/UKCoreDevelopment/Profiles)
* [US Core](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/#us-core-profiles)

Use of these models ensures consistent use of terminology and approach for recording data within a country that
enables broad use of the same Measure across the states, provinces, territories, or other regional divisions.

#### Localizing Value Sets for Implementation
The mechanisms chosen for automation in this guide use value sets for critical vocabulary used to identify relevant
resources for computing measures.  This use of value sets enables an implementation to replace a value set defined
based on the national implementation model for a region with translations to local codes to simplify localization.

The value sets used to automate the computation of a measure must be available to systems that are computing the measure.
These **shall** be recorded in [Library.relatedArtifact](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/library-definitions.html#Library.relatedArtifact)
in at least one of the [library](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.library)
components referenced by the Measure.

### Data Access for Computation
Data access is encouraged through one of three mechanisms, all of which rely on core [FHIR search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html) capabilities.
These mechanisms are described in order from lowest to highest implementation complexity.
1. [FHIR Search](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html) is the basic capability supporing automation. Applications can support counting by using
FHIR queries to select appropriate data elements for evaluation, and then compute measures based on the responses.  This is the most limited
and "chatty" of mechanisms supporting integration, as many servers to not provide search capabilities supporting query across resource
boundaries using different kinds of joins (e.g., chaining and _has search capabilities). Combining FHIR queries with other FHIR capabilities
such as [Bulk Data Access](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/) or [R5 Subscriptions](https://build.fhir.org/subscription.html) can make this
a more efficient process, but integrating with these specifications is beyond the scope of this implementation guide.

2. [FHIRPath](http://hl7.org/fhirpath) is a standalone specification that works with hierarchical models in structured representations (e.g.,
JSON) originally designed for use with FHIR.  It is similar in form and capability to [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/), but has application
to more general models than those represented by an XML document. When [FHIRPath is used within a FHIR Server](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html)
context, the language includes capabilities which support automation of queries, and resolution of resources matching the specified path.

3. [Clinical Quality Language](https://cql.hl7.org/) is an language designed to automate the computation of measures from FHIR and other data models. It enables
localization of models to support variations in organizational workflows and data models.  Several open source implementations of CQL interpreters
are available, but this technology has not yet reached the maturity of other sorts of systems, and it is not always widely available for users
of systems supporting FHIR.

While measures conforming to this guide may use any of the above in expressions, FHIRPath is the preferred format because open source
implementations of FHIRPath are [generally available](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Open+Source+Implementations) for multiple
platforms including Java, JavaScript, .Net, and it supports most of the necessary functions to support comparisons for measures, including
measures with complex date relationships (e.g., Patients acquiring COVID-19 14 days after admission).

A measure **shall** use the same language for all population criteria in the measure.
A measure **should** use the same language for all stratifiers in the measure.

#### Measure Definition Criteria
A Measure is defined by the computable criteria contained in definitions for the Measure
[population](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.group.population.criteria),
[stratifier](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.group.stratifier.criteria) and other criteria components within the measure.
These criteria elements are defined using the [Expression](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes.html#Expression) datatype.  This datatype
requires the language used for the criteria to be defined using one of the following values (cooresponding to mechanisms listed in the
list above):

1. application/x-fhir-query<br/>
   Expressions defined using FHIR Search are defined by the URLs allowed by FHIR [Search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html). The URLs provided
   in the [Expression.expression](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes-definitions.html#Expression.expression) field **shall** be provided as
   relative to the _base_ address of the server that would be queried, and **shall** be expressed in URL syntax according to
   [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) with appropriate %-encoding of the URL components.<br/>
   Conforming systems may, at their own discretion apply [Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) in regard
   to the formatting of URLs. Such expressions **should** use search capabilities defined by national models. Extended search parameters
   are permitted, but these must be defined in a [SearchParameter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter) available in one of the
   [libraries](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.library) referenced by the measure.

2. text/fhirpath<br/>
   Expressions defined in FHIRPath **shall** conform to [FHIRPath](http://hl7.org/fhirpath) and are permitted to use the
   [FHIRPath functions and syntax elements](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html) defined specifically for FHIR.

3. text/cql<br/>
   Expressions defines in CQL **shall** conform to the [Clinical Quality Language](https://cql.hl7.org/), and are permitteed to
   use CQL modules referenced by one of the [libraries](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.library)
   referenced by the measure.

#### Implementation and Conformance
The computable criteria found definitions for the Measure in
[population](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.group.population.criteria),
[stratifier](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.group.stratifier.criteria) and other criteria
components within the measure are deemed to be the "normative" definition of the measure.  However, measure developers may wish to provide
alternative implementations to support application environments that cannot support FHIRPath, or which have access to a high quality CQL
engine. These definitions can be supplied using the [Measure Population Alternate Criteria](StructureDefinition-MeasurePopulationAlternateCriteria.html)
extension. This extension allows alternate criteria to be supplied which can support evaluation on systems not having support for the
preferred (and normative) specification for the measure.

### Other Measure Definition Content
A computable public health measure may reference [ValueSet](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet), [ConceptMap](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/), [CQL definitions](https://cql.hl7.org/), [SearchParameter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter) and
other FHIR conformance resources to support automation. The [PublicHealthMeasureLibrary](StructureDefinition-PublicHealthMeasureLibrary.html) defines
the constraints relevant to referencing the FHIR resources needed to automate measure computation.

### Automated Measure Computation

The process for measure computation relies on several preconditions:

1. The measure establishes the initial context for evaluation by
   defining libraries, value sets, code systems or other resources
   necessary for automating the computation. These can be found in the
   Library resources defined by the measure.
2. A measure is broken up into groups, populations and strata which
   facilitate evaluation.
3. A group evaluates a measurement associated with a specific kind of
   resource or event, e.g., a patient, an admission or patient encounter,
   a lab result, et cetera. This is defined in the groups of the measure as described
   in the [Measure Group Attributes](StructureDefinition-MeasureGroupAttributes.html)
   extension.
4. Populations are evaluated based on queries of resources associated with
   the group, and may depend on other resources defined within the context
   of the measure.  Populations may be defined by refining other
   populations within the group or measure, but at least one population
   (normally the initial population) does not have any unresolved context
   references.  The result of an evaluation is either a collection, in which
   case the population count is computed based on the number of elements
   in the collection, OR it is a singular numeric result or quantity, in
   which case the count is the numeric value.
5. Once a population has been evaluated, it establishes a element within
   the measure context that uses a computable name established by the
   criteria.  This element may enable the evaluation of other populations
   with the measure.  This element contains the collection or
   singular numeric result or quantity returned by the evaluation process.
6. Having evaluated a population, the strata within the population may
   be computable, but could reequire evaluation of other populations.
   Evaluation of strata follow a similar pattern to evaluation of
   populations.

The general algorithm is:

Given a Measure, find a population or strata within a group of the measure
that does not reference an unresolved contextual element. Evaluate that population
or strata and update the context with the evaluted result. If the population
has strata without an unresolved contextual reference, evaluate its strata.

If there are no more unevaluated populations or strata, then evaluation
is complete. There should not be a population or strata that cannot be resolved
because of a missing dependency.  If an implementation detects a case where
a population or stratum cannot be evaluated, it should report an
evaluation error.  It may populate the unpopulated components of the measure
(e.g., count or score) using the
[data-absent-reason](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason)
extension, indicating that the value is unavailable due to an
[error](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-data-absent-reason.html#data-absent-reason-error)
in order to support reporting of partial results while the error condition
is being corrected.

#### Resolving Parameters and Computed Content
Named parameters are essential to support automated measure evaluation. They are used to constrain queries using FHIR Search, FHIRPath
or CQL in order to limit the data retrieved to that which is relevant for measure computation.  The names of parameters used in Measure resources
conforming to this guide **shall** start with an upper case letter, and may contain lowercase letters and numbers, and may contain a perdiod to must match the
regular expression [A-Z][A-Za-z0-9.]+.  They **should** be in _PascalCase_.

FHIRPath and CQL provide mechanisms to provide named parameters (e.g., reporting period) and collections
of FHIR resources during their evaluation.

* FHIR Search<br/>
  To support named parameters in FHIR Queries, this guide uses the notation @_Name_ to indicate a named parameter in a FHIR Query.
  NOTE: @ is general only found in e-mail addresses, which are not relevant for queries used in this guide.

* FHIRPath<br/>
  Parameters in FHIRPath are supported via FHIRPath [Environment Variables](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html#vars).
  This will be shown as %_Name_ in this guide.

* CQL<br/>
  CQL provides for [named parameters](https://cql.hl7.org/02-authorsguide.html#parameters).  This guide uses the notation
  _Name_ to indicate a named parameter in a CQL Expression.

#### Parameter Types
Parameters have a data type, either a FHIR Primitive type such as date, dateTime, or string, or complex types such as Coding, Quantity, Period or Resource and
any of its subtypes (e.g., Patient, Encounter).  The fields of the parameter are accessible via dot notation.

For example:
```
Encounters?status=in-progress,finished&date=gt@ReportingPeriod.start&date=lt@ReportingPeriod.end
```
Will produce a query that selects those encounters which are either active or which finished during the reporting period.

#### Parameters Defined in this Guide
The following parameters are predefined by this guide:

##### Server Details
Base
: The Base parameter is of the FHIR string data type and contains the base address of the FHIR Server associated with a Measure Computer. The Measure
Computer must supply this information. Note that this base endpoint **shall not** end with a "/". This may be used to specify FHIR queries that
should be resolved by the FHIRPath engine within the expression.  This **shall** be the same value found in the
[implementation.url](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.implementation.url) field of the server's
CapabilityStatement.

Metadata
: The Metadata parameter is of the FHIR CapabilityStatement resource type, and contains the Capability statement that would be resolved
by the CapabilityStatement resource. The Measure Computer must supply this information. This **shall** be the equivalent of what is returned
by (%Base + "/metadata").[resolve](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html#functions)().

##### Measure Details
Measure
: The Measure parameter is of the FHIR Measure resource type, and represents the measure being computed.

MeasureReport
: The MeasureReport parameter is of the FHIR MeasureReport resource type, and represents the current
MeasureReport that is being computed.

PriorReport
: The PriorReport parameter is of the FHIR MeasureReport resource type, and represents the details of the
most recent version (e.g., including any corrections) of the MeasureReport that was computed for the prior
reporting period. This simplifies computations for cumulative results, and enables reuse of infrequently
changing values (e.g., total ventilators).

Reporter
: The Reporter parameter is of the FHIR Organization resource type and represents the reporter of
the MeasureReport.  A reference to the reporter can be found in %MeasureReport.reporter.

Subject
: The Subject parameter is of the FHIR Location resource type and represents the subject of the
MeasureReport.  A reference to this subject can be found in %MeasureReport.subject.

##### Date Parameters
Date parameters are essential to support appropriate filters for queries.  This enables essential dates such as the date of evaluation and the
reporting period to be communicated correctly when evaluating the measure.

ReportingPeriod
: The ReportingPeriod parameter is of the FHIR Period data type and contains the starting (inclusive) and ending time (exclusive) of
the reporting period.  It is determined based on the current reporting period as defined in the [ReportingPeriod](StructureDefinition-ReportingPeriod.html)
extension appearing within the Measure. If the reporting period is daily, midnight to midnight, and report is being generated "today", then the reporting
period for it is "yesterday".

PriorReportingPeriod
: The PriorReportingPeriod parameter is of the FHIR Period data type, and contains the starting (inclusive) and ending time (exclusive) of
the immediately prior reporting period. It is determined based on the current reporting period as defined in the
[ReportingPeriod](StructureDefinition-ReportingPeriod.html) extension appearing within the Measure.  If the reporting period is daily, midnight to midnight, and a report
is being generated "today", then the prior reporting period for it is "the day before yesterday". The Prior Reporting period is helpful for obtaining
data from prior measures, for example, to support reporting of cumulative totals.

Today
: This parameter is the "as of" date for the report and is of the FHIR Date data type.  This is functionally equivalent to the FHIRPath
[today()](http://hl7.org/fhirpath/#current-date-and-time-functions) or CQL
[Today()](https://cql.hl7.org/02-authorsguide.html#datetime-operators) functions, save that it is the "date of reporting" rather
than the current time stamp.  It should be used for calculating age of events that are based on the date of reporting.
Generally, this is the day after the reporting period ends for daily measures.

Tomorrow
: This parameter is the day after the "as of date" and is of the FHIR Date data type. It works like the FHIRPath today() function,
but returns the day after today() with respect to the date associated with the report.

Yesterday
: This parameter is the day before the "as of date" and is of the FHIR Date data type. It works like the FHIRPath today() function,
but returns the day before today() with reespeect to the date associated with the report.

##### Library Resources
Attachments in Library resources referenced by a Measure (through Measure.library) are also available as parameters using the name given
to the Attachment in the Attachment.id element (see the notes on [Internal Id Scope](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/element.html#id) for Elements in FHIR).

NOTE: The use of Attachment.id to provide a computable name for the component referenced by the measure addresses the issue that while
ValueSet and other definition resources include a "computable name" intended to support automation. This name is not appropriate for
several reasons:

1. Value Set developers and publishers do not follow the recommendations for computable names, which results in value sets (and other definition resources)
having names that include spaces and other special characters (e.g.
"[COVID_19 (Organism or Substance in Lab Results)](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1146.1203/expansion/Latest)").
2. Measure developers may rely on value sets from multiple sources, which can result in value set names which conflict. However
measure developers can control the names used in the Library resources they use to support a measure.

This guide chose to use a name specified in the id element of the resource because these names

For a give Measure resource, if Measure.library[0].content references a ValueSet resource, Measure.library[0].content.id is
"ReferencedValueSet", then @_ReferencedValueSet_ is a parameter that can be used in a FHIR Query string.  It is available in
a FHIRPath expression as %_ReferencedValueSet_, and in CQL simply as _ReferencedValueSet_.  These parameters are of the type of
the referenced resource.

If "VentPatients" is the id given for an attachment referencing the [Observations for Patients on a Ventilator](ValueSet-PatientsOnVentilator.html)
value set, then @_VentPatients_ may be used in a FHIR Query as follows:

```
Observation?date=gt@ReportingPeriod.start&date=lt@ReportingPeriod.end&code:in=@VentPatients.url&status:not=cancelled&status:not=entered-in-error
```

This query will select all observations whose code in the Value Set referenced by the Attachment whose id is "VentPatients".

The use of value sets in writing measures for automation is critical to avoid mistakes in entering long lists of codes, but pragmatically,
many FHIR implementations will not support the :in or :not-in modifiers.  A MeasureComputer implementing queries **shall** translate these into the
appropriate notation using the FHIR notation for [combining query parameters](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#combining) for servers which
do not understand :in and :not-in.

Servers can declare support for :in and :not-in by fully defining the search capabilities in referenced
[SearchParameter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/searchparameter.html) resources, but in practice, few do.  A MeasureComputer should either verify that
:in and :not-in modifiers are supported (e.g., by executing test queries), or simply translate for all cases.

##### Population Parameters
Populations are often computed iteratively.  For example, it is common to first identify the initial population via a search, and then
the compute the denominator by filtering results from the initial population matching a given criteria, and finally, the numerator by
filtering results from the denominator.

These components can be used in the criteria of other components using FHIRPath or CQL (but not when using FHIR Queries).  To assign a name to the
one of these components, assign an name value to expression defining the population.

#### Illustrating the Use of Parameters
The example below illustrates the use of three different kinds parameters in evaluation:

```
<Measure>
   ...
   <group>
     ...
     <population>
        ...
        <criteria>
           <name value='InitialPop'/>
           <expression value='Encounter.where(...)'/>
        </criteria>
     </population>
     <population>
        ...
        <criteria>
           <name value='VentilatedPatients'/>
           <expression value='Observation.where(
                encounter = %Foo.id and
                code.memberOf(%VentPatients.url)).patient and
                effectiveDateTime >= %ReportingPeriod.start and effectiveDateTime < %ReportingPeriod.end'/>
        </criteria>
     </population>

     ...
   </group>
</Measure>
```

The criteria for the population of the first group of a Measure has the name value of "InitialPop" in the example above.  References to
%_InitialPop_ in other FHIRPath expressions will resolve to the value returned by execution of criteria.expression where
criteria.name = "InitialPop".  So, the example above:

1. Selects a particular set of encounters for the initial population, and defines the variable %_InitialPop_ to reference it by.
2. It defines a second population in terms of the initial population, selecting the
   distinct Patients that have observations that reference encounters found in %_InitialPop_ identified in the previous population,
3. including only those Observations having a code in the ValueSet represented by %VentPatients
4. and which occur during the predefined %_ReportingPeriod_ parameter.
5. Finally, these patients will now be addressable as %_VentilatedPatients_ in other populations in this measure.

For CQL, this value will be a named parameter in the execution of other CQL Expressions.

### Invariants
1. Within a measure, values in population.criteria.expression which are expressed in FHIRPath **may** use:
   1. Variables predefined by [FHIRPath](http://hl7.org/fhirpath/N1/#environment-variables), e.g., %ucum, %context
   2. Variables predefined by [FHIR in its use of FHIRPath](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html#vars), e.g., %sct, %loinc, %"vs-[name]", %"ext-[name]", %resource
   3. Variables explicitely defined by [this guide](#parameters-defined-in-this-guide), e.g., %_ReportingPeriod_, %_Today_, %_Tomorrow_, %_Yesterday_
   4. Variables which have been named in any [Libary.content](#library-resources) item referenced by the Measure, e.g., %_VentPatients_
   5. Variables which have been identified in other [population.criteria.name](#population-parameters) elements found in the Measure. e.g., %_InitialPop_, %_VentilatedPatients_
2. Any other parmeters found **should** be reported as a warning, as implementation may agree on additional parmeters.
3. No two parameters **shall** be provided in the context of a single measure with the same name having different values.
   NOTE: The same resource may be referenced by two different libraries. So long as the URL and content of the resource is the same, the
   name given to it in the referenced measure libaries **may** be identical.
   1. More specifically, a Library **shall not** name a resource with any of the names defined by items 1-3 in rule 1 above,
   2. A Measure **shall not** name a criteria with any of the names defined from items 1-4.
   3. Parameter Names **shall not** be duplicated within a measure or library.


### Implementation Strategies
The MeasureComputer actor is free to use whichever search strategies best fit. Implementers should remember the constraints on Measure
Populations to ensure correct evaluation (e.g., an item in the denominator must be present in the initial population).

While expressions are written in a way that supports use of FHIR Search, a MeasureComputer is NOT required to use FHIR Search capabilities depending
upon how it is implemented.  It may perform queries using [FHIR Bulk Data](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/), FHIR [Batch](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#transaction)
mode queries, internal [data access mechanisms](https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/apidocs/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-api/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/api/dao/IFhirResourceDao.html) such
as those found FHIR Server implementations, or through integration with
[CQL](https://cql.hl7.org/10-c-referenceimplementations.html#appendix-c-reference-implementations) or FHIRPath engines
supporting internal server access.

Measure Computer implementations should consider strategies for data access that avoid overwhelming a connected FHIR Server with repeated requests for
large amounts of data. Depending on the implementation, it may be more efficient to query using easy to evaluate criteria that returns
more than what the measure is looking for, and then filter the results after they have been returned to the Measure Computer.

Measure developers should consider writing evaluation criteria in ways that simplify implementation. For example, when using FHIRPath,
the first part of the expression can be of the form:
```
     (%Base + '/Resource?_include=Resource:*'
            + '&status=allowed-status-values'
            + '&date=ge' + %ReportingPeriod.start
            + '&date=lt' + %ReportingPeriod.end
            + 'other search criteria'

     ).resolve().select(resource)
```
This enables the Measure Computer to start evaluations with data automatically extracted via a FHIR Search.  The _Resource_
should name the type of resource to query for, and _search criteria_ should be a widely supported search that limits the
resources being returned for subsequent filtering by the remainder of thee FHIRPath expression. Consider the use of date
and/or _lastUpdated parameters to restrict the data to the time period relevant to the search.

The second part of the expression should be a [where() or select()](http://hl7.org/fhirpath/#filtering-and-projection)
clause which filters out or projects to other relevant content. This where clause can make use of the FHIRPath
[iif()] function to support short-circuit evaluation of logical expressions.

Additional retrievals can appear in this clause, but should be done after other filtering that can be performed using
available data through FHIRPath. This helps to eliminate excessive queries to the server.
